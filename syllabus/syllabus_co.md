**How to do well in this course**

* Show up punctually and consistently for the lectures and laboratory sections.
* Take notes during the class.
* Do not hesitate to ask questions.
* Find friends to study with. Work on practice problems together, or better yet, pick a problem and then teach each other how to solve it. 
* Be communicative. Not only with the teacher and classmates, but also in online communities. 
* Get familiar with the GNU/Linux environment. Start learning the Unix operating system sufficiently well to meet the demands of the course (gas, ld, gcc, gdb, vi, make, etc). Install Linux in a virtual machine or on a partition on your personal computer. You can find many GNU/Linux guides online.
* Develop skills to find a relevant information in the recommended literature and online.
* Think of a project you can apply your computer organization and machine code knowledge to.
* Try to find unsolved problems (plenty of them!) and come up with ideas to solve those.
* Doing well in this course requires a strong dedication to learning the material and may require a substantial time commitment to complete the programming assignments. **Start early**, and seek help!


**Student Learning Outcomes:**

The following chart shows alignment between course-specific and program student learning outcomes and program goals. [Note: in determining course-specific outcomes, it is important to review the curriculum map to relate the appropriate skill level if specified (e.g. beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Outcomes should be clear, attainable, and measurable.)

| Program Goal  | Program Student Learning Outcomes  | Course Learning Objectives  |
|---|---|---|
| The course helps students understand the basic operation of computing hardware, how it works and how it interfaces with software. | The students completing the course are expected to possess the following skills and abilities: | 1. Theory: Understanding of electronic components, logic gates and CPU architecture |
| | 1. Write simple computer programs in assembly language | 2. Theory: Understanding of the role played by compilers, assemblers, linkers, instruction sets, and hardware |
| | 2. Understand and be familiar with the computer system resources and resource management concepts/algorithms. | 3. Theory: Represent computer resource management different concepts and algorithms. |
| | 3. Possess the skills of system programming and apply their knowledge of computer architectures to programming for performance. | 4. System Programming: Teach  students to practical skills of system programming in Windows and Unix environments. |
| |  |  5. Problem Solving: Get knowledge about hardware peculiarities, problems associated with them, and ways to deal with those problems.|

**Course Structure:**  
Three 50 minute class meetings per week, with homework in accordance with the syllabus. All readings and submissions must be completed on the day due. One project, two midterms and a final exam at the end of the course. Class attendance is mandatory.
Syllabus plan is subject to change and serves mere as a roadmap, rather than exact schedule.

**Method of Evaluation:**

Student learning will be evaluated on the basis of the following weighted components: 

* Homework assignments:	50% of final grade 
* Grade of midterm examinations: 12.5% 
* Grade of final examination: 25% 

**Make-up Procedures:**

Students are required to take tests, exams and quizzes when they are scheduled by the instructor. In the event that a student misses a test, exam or quiz, the instructor is under no obligation to give a make-up, unless the student brings convincing, objective evidence that it was impossible for the student to take it at the scheduled time due to a medical or other emergency. Students should give instructors written notice of any absences from tests, exams or quizzes BEFORE the test, exam or quiz. In the event of an unscheduled quiz, the student should have a good reason for absence. If there is no good reason for the absence, it is up to the instructor to decide how or whether to give a make-up exam or take into account the missing work when calculating the final grade.

**Library and Media/Technology Use**

To enhance their overall learning in the course, students are strongly encouraged to use supplemental online and reference materials available in the library.

**Policy on Grade Appeal**

Students are entitled to appeal grades in line with the university’s Grades Policies policy which is available online at [http://policies.aua.am](http://policies.aua.am)

**Standards for Academic Integrity**

Students are required to conduct themselves in an academically responsible and ethical manner in line with the Student Code of Ethics. Acts of academic dishonesty impair the academic integrity of AUA and create an unfair academic advantage for the student involved and other member(s) of the academic community. These acts are subject to disciplinary measures as prescribed in the AUA Code of Student Ethics [http://policies.aua.am/policy/10](http://policies.aua.am/policy/10)

The Student Code of Conduct can be found at [http://policies.aua.am/policy/101](http://policies.aua.am/policy/101)


**Special Needs:**  
Students requiring special accommodations for learning should contact the Center for Student Success by the end of the Drop/Add period with such requests. studentsuccess@aua.am, [http://studentsuccess.aua.am/disability-support-services/](http://studentsuccess.aua.am/disability-support-services/)
