# The comporg23 groupchat

## Why join the group chat?
Yo! I know this may sound too cumbersome or not worth it, but I want to assure you it is worth it and can positively impact how much you get out of the class!
By joining the group chat, you'll have access to both the professor and the students in a single group chat.
This is a great place to share thoughts on the subject, articles about computers & programming, arts, music, or whatever you feel 
can be interesting for you and the group.

## What is XMPP?
XMPP is an open communication protocol mainly* designed for instant messaging, presence information & contact list management.
It is decentralized, meaning that anyone, including me and you, can run their own XMPP server/instance while communicating with folks from other instances.
That's all you need to know for now.

\* you can do much more with the protocol if you feel like it

## Getting an account
You can get an account at the local jabber.am server by creating one [here](https://jabber.am:5281/conversejs#converse/register)
or at someplace like [404.city](https://404.city) if you feel lost in the interenet/world/simulation.

The registration process should be straightforward from there on.

## Getting a mobile app
If you're on iOS, you should get [Siskin](https://siskin.im/). It's the app that works best for most and should be straight-forward for you.

On Android, get [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/) first, the alternative application store for libre & open-source apps. Then download [Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/)

Here's a video instruction/demo for joining the group chat from iOS using Siskin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWxOUIHDLvA
